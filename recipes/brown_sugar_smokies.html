    <p>These bacon-wrapped little smokies with a brown sugar glaze are yummy! You can make these little smokies on skewers or toothpick them to secure.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package little smokie sausages</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut bacon slices into thirds and wrap each strip around a sausage. Secure the wrapped sausages on wooden skewers, several to a skewer. Arrange the skewers on a baking sheet and sprinkle them liberally with brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bacon is crisp and the brown sugar is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
